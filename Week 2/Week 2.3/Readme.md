# **Week 2 - Day 3: JavaScript Basics and Advanced Concepts - Summary**

---

## **Morning Session: JavaScript Fundamentals**

### **Key Concepts**
1. **Conditionals**:
   - Implemented decision-making using:
     - `if-else`
     - `else if`
     - `switch-case`
     - Ternary operators.
   - Learned about **truthy** and **falsy** values.

2. **Loops**:
   - Mastered different types:
     - `for`, `while`, `do-while`, `forEach`, `for...in`, `for...of`.
   - Loops help in iterating over arrays, strings, and objects.

3. **Functions**:
   - Explored:
     - **Function Statements**
     - **Function Expressions**
     - **Anonymous Functions**
     - **Fat Arrow Functions** (ES6).
   - Learned about `return` to pass values from functions.

4. **Undefined, Not Defined, Null**:
   - **Undefined**: Declared but not assigned.
   - **Not Defined**: Variable not declared.
   - **Null**: Represents intentional absence of value.

## **Afternoon Session: Advanced JavaScript**

### **Key Topics**

1. **Arrays**:
   - Arrays store multiple values in a single variable.
   - Explored methods to iterate through arrays using loops.

2. **Objects**:
   - Used objects to store key-value pairs.
   - Accessed and manipulated object properties dynamically.

3. **Prototypes**:
   - Introduced the concept of prototypes for **method sharing** among objects.
   - Learned about **Prototypal Inheritance**.

4. **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous JavaScript**:
   - **Synchronous**: Executes code line by line.
   - **Asynchronous**: Handles tasks like API calls, setTimeout, promises, etc., non-linearly.

5. **ES6 Features**:
   - **Arrow Functions** simplify syntax.
   - **Template Literals** for string interpolation.
   - **Spread Operator** for array and object cloning.
   - **Default Parameters** to handle function arguments.
   - **Destructuring** for extracting values from objects/arrays.

---

## **Highlights**
- Gained hands-on experience in working with **arrays** and **objects**.
- Understood **prototypes** and how inheritance works in JavaScript.
- Strengthened knowledge about JavaScript execution models with **synchronous** and **asynchronous** behavior.
- Explored powerful **ES6 features** to write cleaner and more efficient code.

## **Key Takeaways**
1. Mastery of **conditionals**, **loops**, and **functions** lays the foundation for JavaScript programming.
2. Arrays and objects are indispensable for structuring and manipulating data.
3. Understanding **synchronous vs. asynchronous** execution is vital for handling modern web development tasks.
4. Prototypes and inheritance streamline behavior sharing in object-oriented programming.
5. ES6 introduced modern syntax to enhance readability, performance, and scalability.
