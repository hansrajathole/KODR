# **3.4 - OOP and DOM Manipulation**

This session focused on improving problem-solving and implementation skills using **JavaScript OOP principles** and **DOM Manipulation**. The tasks involved creating interactive web elements and utilizing object-oriented programming for modular, reusable code.
---

## **📂 Topics Covered**

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
  - Classes and Objects
  - Encapsulation and Modular Code
  - Constructor Functions
  - Methods and Prototypes
- **DOM Manipulation**:
  - Selecting and modifying elements dynamically
  - Event handling for user interactions
  - Updating HTML structure programmatically
  - Responsive UI updates with JavaScript

## **📝 Tasks Solved**

### **Task 1: Dynamic Progress Bar**

- Created a download progress bar with:
  - Real-time updates
  - Reset functionality
  - Randomized progress intervals
- **Key Learning**: Used DOM manipulation and event listeners to handle dynamic updates.

### **Task 2: Social Media Post Feed**

- Designed a dynamic post feed with user stories and interactive features:
  - Displayed user profiles, posts, and actions (like, comment, share).
  - Added click-to-open story modals with progress animations.
- **Key Learning**: Utilized OOP principles to modularize story and post creation.
