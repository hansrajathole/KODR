## **üìù Task Details**

### **Task 26: Fibonacci Series**
- **Objective**: Generate a Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms.
- **Example**:
  - Input: `5`
  - Output: `0 1 1 2 3`
- **Logic**:
  - Start with `0` and `1` as the initial terms.
  - Use a `for` loop to compute subsequent terms by summing the previous two numbers.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Loops**: Used a `for` loop for iteration.
  - **String Concatenation**: Dynamically built the series string.

### **Task 28: Calculator**
- **Objective**: Perform basic arithmetic operations interactively with a menu-driven program.
- **Operations**:
  - `1`: Addition
  - `2`: Subtraction
  - `3`: Multiplication
  - `4`: Division
  - `5`: Exit the program
- **Example**:
  - Input: `1 (Addition)`
  - Numbers: `5`, `7`
  - Output: `Sum = 12`
- **Logic**:
  - Used a `do-while` loop for continuous interaction.
  - Implemented a `switch` statement to handle different operations based on user input.
  - Provided an option to exit the program or continue with a new calculation.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Control Flow**:
    - `do-while` for repeated execution.
    - `switch-case` for menu-driven operations.
  - **Dynamic Input Handling**: Used `prompt` for user interaction.
  - **Error Handling**: Managed invalid choices and unexpected inputs gracefully.

## **üí° Key Learnings**
1. **Iterative Logic**:
   - Constructed sequences like the Fibonacci series using loops.
   - Dynamically calculated terms based on a logical pattern.

2. **Control Structures**:
   - Used `if-else` and `switch-case` for decision-making.
   - Incorporated `do-while` loops for repeated user interaction.

3. **Dynamic User Interaction**:
   - Gained experience in taking inputs and displaying results using `prompt` and `alert`.
   - Built user-friendly logic to handle unexpected scenarios like invalid inputs.

4. **Mathematical Operations**:
   - Mastered addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through real-world scenarios.

## **üöÄ How to Run**
1. Copy the JavaScript code snippets into your preferred text editor or browser console.
2. Execute the code.
3. For **Task 28**:
   - Follow the interactive menu prompts to perform operations.
