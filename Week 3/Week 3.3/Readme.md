## **üìå Highlights of Implemented Concepts**

### **1. Conditional Statements**
- Implemented decision-making using `if-else` to handle various scenarios, such as:  
  - Determining **discount rates** based on a total amount.  
  - Calculating **electricity bills** for different consumption tiers.

### **2. Arithmetic Operations**
- Performed calculations to derive results such as:  
  - Total **billable amount** after applying dynamic rates.  
  - Final **payable amount** after applying discounts.

### **3. Loops**
- Utilized `for` loops for efficient repetitive calculations, allowing for iterative processing of user-provided input values.

### **4. User Input Handling**
- Gathered inputs using `prompt()` to dynamically calculate results based on user data.

## **üîç Task Details**

### **Task 13: Electricity Bill Calculation**
- **Description**: Calculate the electricity bill based on tiered rates.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - Units up to 100 are charged at **‚Çπ4.2/unit**.  
  - Units 101‚Äì200 are charged at **‚Çπ6/unit**.  
  - Units 201‚Äì400 are charged at **‚Çπ8/unit**.  
  - Units above 400 are charged at **‚Çπ13/unit**.  
- **Example Input**: `150 units`  
- **Output**: `‚Çπ630`

### **Task 14: Discount Calculation**
- **Description**: Apply dynamic discount rates based on the total purchase amount.  
- **Key Points**:  
  - Purchases up to ‚Çπ5,000 have no discount.  
  - ‚Çπ5,001‚Äì‚Çπ7,000: **5% discount**.  
  - ‚Çπ7,001‚Äì‚Çπ9,000: **10% discount**.  
  - Above ‚Çπ9,000: **20% discount**.  
- **Example Input**: `‚Çπ8,000`  
- **Output**: `‚Çπ7,200`
