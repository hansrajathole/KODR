# **Lecture 05: Form Handling and Working with Forms**

## **1. Handling Forms in the Backend**
- Forms are an essential way for users to send data to the server.
- Backend processes ensure:
  - Data sent from the frontend (HTML, frontend libraries, or frameworks) is securely and correctly handled.
  - Validation and sanitization of user input before storing or processing it further.
  - Templating engines can also be used to dynamically render forms with backend data.

---

## **2. What are Sessions and Cookies?**
### **Understanding Sessions**
- A **session** represents a connection between the client (browser) and the server.
- When you send a request to the server (e.g., logging in, submitting a form), the server establishes a session to recognize you temporarily.
- Sessions are **stored on the server** and associated with a unique identifier (often shared with the client as a cookie).

---

### **Understanding Cookies**
- A **cookie** is a small piece of data sent from the server and stored on the client-side (browser).
- When a client sends subsequent requests to the server, the cookie is sent along with the request, helping the server recognize the client.

### **How Sessions and Cookies Work Together**  
1. **Initial Request:**
   - The client sends a request to the server (e.g., logging in).
   - The server creates a session, assigns it a unique ID, and sends a cookie containing the session ID to the client.

2. **Subsequent Requests:**
   - The client includes the cookie in subsequent requests.
   - The server reads the cookie, matches it with the session ID, and recognizes the client.

3. **Logout:**
   - The session is destroyed on the server, and the client no longer has access.

---

### **Key Points:**
- Without cookies or sessions, the server would treat every request as coming from a new client.
- **Analogy:**
  - Imagine entering a building where you need to verify your identity every time you interact with someone. A cookie is like an ID badge that proves who you are after the first interaction.

### **Code Example for Enabling Form Data Handling**
To handle form submissions in Express.js, you need to enable middleware to parse data sent from the client.

#### **Setup Code:**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware to parse JSON data
app.use(express.json());

// Middleware to parse URL-encoded form data
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Example route to handle form submission
app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
    const { name, email } = req.body; // Extract data from the form
    res.send(`Name: ${name}, Email: ${email}`);
});

// Starting the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

#### **What Does This Do?**
1. `express.json()`: Parses incoming JSON data from the client (useful for APIs).
2. `express.urlencoded({ extended: true })`: Parses URL-encoded form data (standard form submissions).

## **3. Example of Session and Cookie Implementation**

### **Install Required Package**
```bash
npm install express-session
```

### **Session and Cookie Example**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const session = require('express-session');
const app = express();

// Setting up session middleware
app.use(session({
    secret: 'your-secret-key', // Secret used to sign the session ID cookie
    resave: false, // Prevents resaving the session if it hasn’t changed
    saveUninitialized: true // Saves a session even if it’s uninitialized
}));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    if (req.session.views) {
        req.session.views++;
        res.send(`Welcome back! You have visited this page ${req.session.views} times.`);
    } else {
        req.session.views = 1;
        res.send('Hello! This is your first visit.');
    }
});

// Clearing session on logout
app.get('/logout', (req, res) => {
    req.session.destroy(() => {
        res.send('Logged out. Goodbye!');
    });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

---

### **How It Works:**
1. **`express-session` Middleware:**
   - Creates and manages sessions for incoming requests.
2. **Session Data:**
   - Stored server-side, linked with a session ID.
3. **Session Persistence:**
   - A session persists across requests as long as the session ID (stored in a cookie) is sent with each request.

---

## **4. Secure Form Handling Best Practices**
1. **Validate Input:**
   - Ensure form fields have appropriate constraints both client-side and server-side.
   - Example: Ensure an email field contains a valid email format.
   
2. **Sanitize Input:**
   - Prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) by sanitizing input data.
   - Example: Use libraries like `validator.js` or `DOMPurify`.

3. **HTTPS:**
   - Always use HTTPS to encrypt data during transit.

4. **Session Security:**
   - Use secure cookies (`secure: true`), especially in production.
   - Implement session expiration and invalidation upon logout.

---

## **5. Advanced Topics in Form Handling**
- **Templating Engines:**
  - Use engines like **EJS**, **Pug**, or **Handlebars** to render dynamic forms from the backend.

- **File Uploads:**
  - Use libraries like `multer` for handling file uploads via forms.

- **CSRF Protection:**
  - Implement CSRF tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.

### **Complete Example: Handling Form with Session and Cookies**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const session = require('express-session');
const app = express();

// Middleware
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(session({
    secret: 'secret-key',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: true
}));

// Route to display a form
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send(`
        <form method="POST" action="/submit">
            <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" required />
            <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required />
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    `);
});

// Handling form submission
app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
    const { username, password } = req.body;
    req.session.username = username; // Storing username in session
    res.send(`Welcome, ${username}! Your session is active.`);
});

// Logout route
app.get('/logout', (req, res) => {
    req.session.destroy(() => {
        res.send('You have been logged out.');
    });
});

// Start server
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```
