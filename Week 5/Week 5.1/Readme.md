# **Week 5 - Day 1: Summary**  

Today was a productive day, divided into two insightful sessions. Here's an overview of what we accomplished:  

---

## **Session 1: React Components**  

### **Topics Covered**  
1. **Breaking Down UI into Components**  
   - Learned how to analyze a user interface and split it into reusable React components.  
   - Assignment: Break the provided UI into multiple components and visualize the structure.  

2. **Creating the `Greet` Component**  
   - Created a `Greet` component using **function declaration** syntax.  
   - Refactored the same component into **arrow function** syntax.  
   - Registered the `Greet` component in the `App.jsx` file to render it successfully.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- **Modular Thinking**: Understand the importance of dividing UI into small, manageable components.  
- **React Component Syntax**: Learned the difference between function declaration and arrow function syntax in React.

## **Session 2: Data Structure Programming Challenges**  

### **Problems Solved**  
We tackled a series of programming problems to strengthen our problem-solving skills.  

1. **Multiplication Table**  
   - Printed the multiplication table for a given number.  

2. **Movie Rating System**  
   - Rated movies based on their scores.  

3. **ISBN Validator**  
   - Checked whether a number is a valid ISBN.  

4. **HCF/GCD Finder**  
   - Calculated the highest common factor of two numbers.  

5. **Harshad Number**  
   - Determined if a number is divisible by the sum of its digits.  

6. **Perfect Square Validator**  
   - Checked whether a number is a perfect square.  

7. **Abundant Number Detector**  
   - Verified if a number is an abundant number (sum of divisors > number).  

8. **Fibonacci Series Generator**  
   - Generated the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms.  

9. **Numbers with X Divisors Finder**  
   - Found numbers with exactly `X` divisors.  

10. **Prime Factorization**  
    - Listed all prime factors of a number.  

11. **Area Calculator**  
    - Calculated the area of circles, rectangles, and triangles.  

12. **Neon Number Checker**  
    - Verified if a number is a neon number (sum of digits of its square equals the number).  

13. **Sum of Even-Indexed Fibonacci Numbers**  
    - Calculated the sum of Fibonacci numbers at even indexes.

## **Key Takeaways from the Session**  

- **React Basics**: Grasped the foundational principles of React components and their structure.  
- **Problem Solving**: Practiced implementing brute-force techniques to solve mathematical and logical problems.  
- **Versatility with JavaScript**: Strengthened understanding of JavaScript by applying loops, conditionals, and array operations.

## **Quote of the Day**  
_"The essence of React is breaking down a problem into smaller pieces, and programming is about solving those pieces effectively."_

### **Goals for Tomorrow**  
1. Dive deeper into React with props and state management.  
2. Tackle intermediate-level data structure problems.
