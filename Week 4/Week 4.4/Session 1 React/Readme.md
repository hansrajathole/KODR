# **Session 1: Setting Up a React Project with Vite**

This session focused on setting up a React project using **Vite**, a modern and fast build tool. It covered installing **Node.js**, creating a React project, and running the application locally.

---

## **ðŸ“‚ Key Concepts**

1. **Installing Node.js**:
   - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime required for running Vite and npm commands.
2. **Vite**:
   - A faster alternative to traditional React setups (like Create React App).
   - Provides a lightweight and efficient development experience.
3. **React**:
   - A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

---

## **ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Guide**

### **1. Install Node.js**
**Why?**  
Node.js provides `npm` (Node Package Manager), which is essential for managing dependencies and running React projects.

**Steps**:  
1. Go to the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download and install the **LTS version** (recommended for most users).
3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   This will display the installed versions of Node.js and npm.

### **2. Create a React Project with Vite**
**Why Vite?**  
Vite offers:
- Faster project setup.
- Optimized build times.
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for rapid development.

**Steps**:  
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to create your project:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/folder
   ```
2. Create a new Vite project:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest
   ```
3. Enter the following details when prompted:
   - **Project Name**: (e.g., `my-react-app`).
   - **Framework**: Select `React`.
   - **Variant**: Select `JavaScript` or `TypeScript` based on your preference.

---

### **3. Install Project Dependencies**
Once the project is created:
1. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd my-react-app
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

### **4. Run the React Application**
Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start a local server (typically at `http://localhost:5173`), where you can view your React app in the browser.

## **ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure of the Vite React Project**
After setup, the project will have the following structure:
```plaintext
my-react-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/               # Static assets (e.g., images)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                  # Source code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx           # Main App component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.css         # Global styles
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.jsx          # Entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html            # HTML template
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # Project metadata and dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.js        # Vite configuration
â””â”€â”€ node_modules/         # Installed dependencies
```
