     class="h-[30em] absolute rounded-xl hidden"
     alt=""
   />
   ```

2. **Smooth Scrolling**:

   ```javascript
   const scroll = new LocomotiveScroll({
     el: document.querySelector("#main"),
     smooth: true,
   });
   ```

3. **Responsive Image Sizing**:
   - Used Tailwind utilities like `w-[9em]` for image dimensions.
