## **Session 2: JSX**  

## **Key Learnings**  

### **1. What is JSX?**  
- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your React components.  
- It combines the power of JavaScript with the simplicity of HTML.  

### **2. Benefits of JSX:**  
1. **Improved Readability**: Makes components easy to write and understand.  
2. **Component Structure**: Allows clear separation of UI logic into reusable components.  
3. **JavaScript Integration**: Enables the use of JavaScript expressions directly within the UI.  

### **3. JSX Rules to Remember**  
- Every JSX element must be enclosed within a single parent element.  
- Use **camelCase** for HTML attributes (e.g., `className` instead of `class`).  
- Embed JavaScript expressions using `{}`.
