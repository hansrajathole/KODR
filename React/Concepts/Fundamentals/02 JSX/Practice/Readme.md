### JSX: Your First Steps 

This exercise will guide you through creating your first React component using JSX. Let's get started!

#### 1. Building the WelcomeMessage Component

1.  **Create a New File:** Create a new file named `WelcomeMessage.jsx`. 
2.  **Define the Component:** Inside this file, define a functional React component called `WelcomeMessage`.
3.  **Compose the JSX:** Within the `WelcomeMessage` component, return a `<div>` element. This `<div>` should contain:
    *   A `<h1>` element displaying "Hello, World!".
    *   A `<p>` element displaying "Welcome to learning JSX!".

#### 2. Bringing it to Life in App.jsx

1.  **Open App.jsx:** Locate and open the `App.jsx` file.
2.  **Import the Component:** At the top of the `App.jsx` file, import the `WelcomeMessage` component you just created.
3.  **Render the Component:** In the `App` component's `return` statement, render the `WelcomeMessage` component.

#### 3. Witness Your Creation!

1.  **Run the Application:** Execute your React application in your development environment.
2.  **Behold:** In your browser, you should now see "Hello, World!" and "Welcome to learning JSX!" displayed on the screen.

Congratulations! You've successfully created your first React component using JSX.
