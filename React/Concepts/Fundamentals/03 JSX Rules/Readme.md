### **Session 03 : JSX: The Rules of the Game**

This exercise will guide you through understanding and applying the core rules of writing JSX in React. Let's dive in!

#### 1. The JSXRules Component

1.  **Create the Component:** Create a new file named `JSXRules.jsx`. Inside, define a functional React component called `JSXRules`.
2.  **Structure the Output:** Within the `JSXRules` component, return a `<div>` element. This `<div>` will act as the parent element for the following:
    *   A `<h1>` element displaying "JSX Rules".
    *   A `<p>` element that outlines at least 3 fundamental rules of JSX:
        *   **Single Parent Rule:** JSX must always return a single parent element.
        *   **Proper Closure:** All JSX elements must be properly closed.
        *   **CamelCase Attributes:** JSX attributes are written using camelCase (e.g., `className` instead of `class`).

#### 2. Test Your Knowledge

Once you've completed the `JSXRules` component, try to intentionally violate each of the JSX rules mentioned in the `<p>` element. Observe the errors or warnings that your development environment displays. This hands-on experience will solidify your understanding of these critical rules.
