**Week 9 Day 1 DSA Session - Revision Lecture**

This repository contains JavaScript code for basic array operations:

**1. Generate Random Array**

* **Description:** Creates an array of a specified size, filled with random integers.

**2. Sum of Array Elements**

* **Description:** Calculates the sum of all elements in an array.

**3. Find Maximum Element**

* **Description:** Finds and returns the maximum element in an array.

**4. Find First and Second Maximum Elements**

* **Description:** Finds and returns the first and second maximum elements in an array.

**Note:**

* These are basic implementations for learning purposes.
* You can further enhance these solutions by:
    * Adding input validation and error handling.
    * Implementing more efficient algorithms.
    * Exploring different data structures and algorithms for solving similar problems.
