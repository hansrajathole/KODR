## **Session 1: DSA - 2D Arrays**
In this session, we explored **2D Arrays** and their applications in solving data structure problems. Key concepts covered include:

### **Key Operations**
1. **Initialization of a 2D Array**:  
   ```javascript
   let arr = [
       [1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6],
       [7, 8, 9],
   ];
   ```

2. **Traversal of a 2D Array**:  
   Nested loops are used to traverse rows and columns.  
   ```javascript
   for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
       for (let j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
           console.log(arr[i][j]);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Common Problems Solved**:
   - Matrix Transposition
   - Row-wise and Column-wise Summation
   - Diagonal Traversals
