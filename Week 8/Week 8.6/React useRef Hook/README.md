**🚀 Refueling Your React Components with `useRef` ⚡️**

This exercise will guide you through the exciting world of `useRef` in React! We'll explore how to use this powerful hook to:

**Step 1: Focusing on the Input with `useRef` 🎯**

1. Create a file named `FocusInput.jsx`.
2. Inside, craft a functional component that can magically focus on an input field whenever a button is clicked. We'll achieve this by using the `useRef` hook to grab a reference to the input element. 

**Step 2: Building a Persistent Timer with `useRef` ⏱️**

1. Create a file named `Timer.jsx`.
2. Inside, build a component that creates a simple timer. But here's the twist: we'll use `useRef` to store the timer's interval, ensuring it persists even when the component re-renders. This will make our timer run smoothly and reliably.
