### 💡 **Key Learnings**  

1. **Flutter Landing Page Development**:  
   - Built a **responsive landing page** for Flutter, with designs tailored to **desktop** and **mobile views**.
   - Focused on crafting layouts with a balance of flexibility and visual appeal.

2. **SCSS for Efficient Styling**:  
   - SCSS makes coding styles more efficient by:  
     - Supporting **nesting**, **variables**, and **mixins** for reusable code.  
     - Enabling a cleaner, more organized CSS structure.  

3. **Responsive Units**:  
   - Learned the proper usage of units like:  
     - `vh`, `vw`: For viewport height and width, making elements adaptable to screen size.  
     - `rem`, `em`: For font sizes and spacing relative to root and parent elements.  
     - `%`: For proportional scaling of elements.  

4. **Modern CSS Functions**:  
   - Utilized:  
     - `max()`: To set the largest possible value for a property.  
     - `min()`: To limit properties to the smallest possible value.  
     - `clamp()`: To define a value range for properties (`min`, `preferred`, `max`).
